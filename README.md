The contents of this project was done by me and four other students of Ã–rebro University. The project was about creating the different modules that a robot consists off. Our group was tasked with the "brain" of the robot implementing principles learned in the artificial intelligence course we had prior to this project. We all worked on this project together to create an HTN planner that takes input given over an MQTT based communication protocol from the other modules ("mission control", "motion planning", "perception" and "simulation"). When integerating with the other groups there was reason to add a topological map and that is done by using voronoi.
